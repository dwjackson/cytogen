.Sh DESCRIPTION
The cymkd_render function is used to render a string that contains markdown
markup data to an HTML file. Similarly, the cymkd_render_file function is used
to render a file directly from a FILE pointer. Internally it will read the
file into a string and render the string. The cymkd_render_fd function is
similar to cymkd_render_file, except it takes a file descriptors for input and
output. Note that the input file descriptor cannot correspond to stdin.
